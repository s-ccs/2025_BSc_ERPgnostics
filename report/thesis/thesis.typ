= Introduction <chp:introduction>

== Motivation
If we want to understand how the brain reacts to what a person sees, hears, or
does, we need measurements that are fast, practical, and repeatable. EEG is
one such method: it records electrical activity at the scalp, and ERPs are
patterns that become visible when we align those recordings to repeated events.
For the purpose of this introduction, this rough intuition is enough. Chapter 2
explains both concepts more carefully. ERPs remain widely used in human
neuroscience, and the literature now spans a broad range of paradigms and
application areas @Kappenman2021 @Donoghue2022.

As soon as these experiments become larger, the analysis problem changes.
Researchers may have many recordings, but deciding which patterns are
meaningful still takes time and expert judgment. This is why automation is
attractive: deep learning can learn structured patterns from complex signals,
but it still depends on labelled examples that are rarely available at the same
scale as the raw recordings @Roy2019.

This thesis starts from that bottleneck. Instead of waiting for large manually
annotated datasets, we use data simulation to create labelled ERP images under
controlled assumptions. Tools such as UnfoldSim.jl make that possible and shift
the central question to the point that matters in practice: can a model
trained on ERP images from data simulation still recognise the relevant
sigmoid pattern in real recordings @Schepers2025.

== Research Questions and Contributions
// State the main research question, sketch the sim-to-real idea at a high
// level, and list the concrete contributions of the thesis.
// Mention the reduced scope here as part of the framing.

== Thesis Structure
// Briefly guide the reader through the remaining chapters.

// the literature without overloading the early draft.

= Background and Related Work <chp:background>

== EEG, ERPs, and ERP Images
// Explain the signal domain, what ERP images represent, and why the sigmoid
// pattern is a meaningful target.

== CNN-Based Pattern Detection in ERP Data
// Introduce CNNs only to the degree needed for this thesis and summarize how
// automated ERP or EEG classification has been approached in prior work.

== Data Simulation, Sim-to-Real Transfer, and Semi-Supervised Learning
// Explain why simulation is attractive, why the sim-to-real gap matters, and
// how prior work has tried to bridge similar gaps.

== Research Gap and Positioning
// Close the chapter by stating clearly what is still missing in the literature
// and where this thesis contributes.

// Chapter 3 - Describe the empirical pipeline in one place.
// For an initial draft this is easier to navigate than splitting data and
// methods into separate chapters.

= Data and Methods <chp:data-methods>

== Datasets, Annotation, and Task Definition
At the time of writing, the project uses two real-data sources. The fixation TODO NEEDS SOURCE
dataset remains the main source for manual annotation and direct validation,
while an ERP CORE P3 derivative has been prepared as an unseen cross-domain
dataset with per-subject epochs and reaction times @Kappenman2021. MORE TO COME

The manual labelling workflow was first set up in Label Studio on 100
images and was later expanded to 400 additional unique images @LabelStudio. Labeling images with this Web user interface was more efficient that expected hence more images can be labelled in a shorter time. Moreover having more data to train and evaluate a model against with brings better robustness and genaralisation, as more pattern gestalts and noise can be used.

Figure @fig:pattern-decision-tree shows a first draft of the manual
pattern-labelling tree. It first asks whether a visible pattern is present and
then separates local patterns from patterns that extend across time.

#pattern-decision-tree <fig:pattern-decision-tree>

This is a working aid for annotation and not yet a final rule set.

== Data Simulation and Preprocessing
Several preprocessing were explored, but these runs were not
evaluated with the later reporting setup and are therefore not treated as
model results. The exploratory comparisons include different scalin methods: nearest-neighbour,
linear, quadratic, cubic, and Lanczos resizing, 

pipelines with and without Gaussian smoothing filtering, z-scoring before versus after resizing, value
binning in the ERP matrix, and input resolutions from `16x16` to `256x256`.

The real-data path currently sorts trials, applies per-timepoint z-scoring,
performs Gaussian low-pass filtering, and resizes the image to the model input
size. 

Additional explored data augmentation,
morphological operations, edge detectors, denoising, contrast
normalisation, gradient-based channels, and anti-aliased resizing. These
experiments were useful for narrowing the design space, but they did not
produce a retained improvement in classification performance at that stage.

== Data Simulation and Calibration Results
TABEL

For now no result, model labels randomly

== Classification Performance Real Data
TABEL
This part already produced the clearest quantitative results. A first direct
validation of the current `64x64` binary CNN against the 500 manual labels
reached an accuracy of 0.284 and an F1 score of 0.175 for the pattern class,
which shows that the initial sim-to-real transfer is still weak.

Later five-fold experiments on the manually labelled data gave balanced
accuracy values of 0.500 for both `cnn_1conv` and `cnn_3conv`, 0.600445 for
`cnn_10conv`, and 0.849564 with `macro_f1 = 0.857006` for
`resnet18_pretrained` at `64x64`. A resolution sweep then showed that
`128x128` improved the same model to `balanced_accuracy = 0.905729` and
`macro_f1 = 0.896564`, whereas `256x256` was slower and less stable at
`balanced_accuracy = 0.868976`.

The real-data processing comparison also produced a first ranking of practical
changes. Per-image clipping to q01/q99 and scaling to `[-1, 1]` gave only
small gains over the `64x64` baseline, while balancing the classes improved the
current `resnet18_pretrained` setup to `balanced_accuracy = 0.897182` and
`macro_f1 = 0.895754`. By contrast, the best current two-channel filter
variant, based on a Laplacian second channel, remained slightly below the
simpler one-channel baseline with `balanced_accuracy = 0.841661` and
`macro_f1 = 0.85117`.
